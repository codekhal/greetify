## About

> Summer SDE-Intern Hiring Challenge-Innovaccer

A desktop app build on top of Electron - an open source framework which can be used for creating cross platform desktop native applications. This app handles entry management system for easy office Checkins and Checkouts. This project allows a host and a user to fill in their details and timestamp of their entry is generated automatically. ALso, Database handling for storing and fetching the data is done via [Firebase real-time database system](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database). For mailing and messaging system [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) and [Nexmo api](https://www.nexmo.com/products/sms) respectively is been setup. <br>
Currently as a MVP(minimal viable product), I made this as an assignment submission for the innovacer [summergeeks](https://summergeeks.in/) summer internship challenge.
